# SafarSmart - Travel Itinerary Planner

SafarSmart is a comprehensive web application designed to simplify and enhance your travel planning experience. It allows users to create, manage, and detail their travel itineraries with ease, incorporating AI-powered planning capabilities.

## Features

-   **User Authentication:** Secure registration, login, and password management.
-   **Trip Management:** Create, view, update, and delete your travel plans.
-   **Detailed Itinerary Planning:** Organize accommodation, track expenses, and get activity suggestions.
-   **AI-Powered Planning:** Leverages Langchain/LangGraph for intelligent trip suggestions and itinerary generation.
-   **Responsive Design:** A user-friendly interface accessible across various devices.

## AI Agents and LangGraph Integration

SafarSmart leverages the power of **Langchain** and **LangGraph** to provide intelligent, AI-driven trip planning capabilities. The core of this functionality resides in a network of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the trip planning process.

### How it Works

The AI agents operate within a **LangGraph workflow**, allowing for a structured and sequential execution of tasks to build a comprehensive trip plan. When a user initiates a trip planning request, the system orchestrates the following agents in a defined flow:

1.  **Itinerary Generator (`generate_itinerary`):** Based on user preferences (destination, duration, budget, etc.), this agent crafts a detailed day-by-day itinerary, including dining options and downtime suggestions.

2.  **Accommodation Recommender (`accommodation_recommender_agent`):** This agent searches for and recommends suitable accommodations, providing details like ratings, snippets, and booking links.

3.  **Expense Breakdown Agent (`expense_breakdown_agent`):** It estimates and breaks down the total trip cost into categories such as accommodation, food, activities, and transportation, based on the destination and budget type.

4.  **Complete Trip Plan Synthesizer (`complete_trip_plan_agent`):** This final agent synthesizes all the information generated by the preceding agents (itinerary, accommodation, expenses, activities, weather, etc.) into a single, comprehensive, and visually appealing trip plan. It enriches the plan with local insights, practical advice, and relevant links.

### Other Specialized Agents

In addition to the main workflow, several other agents are available to provide specific information or handle user interactions:

-   **Activity Recommender (`recommend_activities_agent`):** Suggests unique local activities and attractions using external search capabilities.
-   **Useful Links Fetcher (`fetch_useful_links_agent`):** Gathers general travel tips and guides relevant to the destination.
-   **Weather Forecaster (`weather_forecaster_agent`):** Provides detailed weather forecasts and advises travelers based on the destination and month.
-   **Packing List Generator (`packing_list_generator_agent`):** Creates a comprehensive packing list tailored to the holiday type, destination, and expected weather.
-   **Food & Culture Recommender (`food_culture_recommender_agent`):** Recommends popular local dishes, dining options, and provides insights into cultural norms and etiquette.
-   **Chat Agent (`chat_agent`):** Handles general user questions and can modify the complete trip plan based on user requests, providing an interactive conversational experience.

This modular agent-based architecture ensures that each aspect of trip planning is handled by a specialized AI, leading to highly detailed, accurate, and personalized travel itineraries.
